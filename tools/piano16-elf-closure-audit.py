"""
Xiaomi Pad 8 Pro (piano) — TWRP16 recovery ramdisk ELF closure audit.

This is the compensating gate for ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES. That flag lets
Soong skip modules whose dependencies are absent instead of failing the build,
which means a library the recovery genuinely needs could be silently dropped
and produce an image that builds cleanly but breaks at runtime.

This audit answers that directly: it unpacks the built recovery ramdisk,
resolves every ELF binary and shared library it contains, and fails if any
DT_NEEDED cannot be satisfied from inside the image itself.

Usage:
    piano16-elf-closure-audit.py <recovery.img> [--verbose]

Exit 0 only when the closure is complete.
