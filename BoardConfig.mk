#
# TWRP 16 / Android 16 device configuration for the Xiaomi Pad 8 Pro (piano).
#
# Written for the native Android-16 base, not ported from the TWRP14 tree. The
# TWRP14 configuration stays frozen at device/xiaomi/piano in ~/android/twrp-14
# and is referenced only for hardware facts that were proven on the device.
#
# ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES — enabled deliberately, with a compensating gate.
#
# The TWRP manifest is a reduced AOSP checkout: it ships projects whose Soong
# dependencies live in projects it omits, and Soong parses every Android.bp in
# the tree regardless of build target. Removing the unneeded consumers was
# tried first and diverged: 32 errors -> 20 -> 26, and removing
# packages/modules/Connectivity broke system/netd, which recovery links through
# libnetd_client. AOSP projects cross-reference too heavily for that approach
# to terminate.
#
# The risk this flag carries is real: a module our recovery actually needs
# could be silently skipped instead of failing the build. That risk is
# answered by a mandatory ELF closure audit of the produced ramdisk before any
# image is flashed - every binary and shared library is resolved and any
# unresolved DT_NEEDED fails the gate. See docs/twrp16-first-image-elf-audit.md.
#
# This flag does not affect this device tree's own dependencies, which resolve
# completely. BUILD_BROKEN_* is still NOT set.

# The device never enumerates USB in any mode and has to be forced into
# fastboot by hand.
#
# The kernel config is not sufficient evidence here. /proc/config.gz reports
# CONFIG_RD_GZIP=y, CONFIG_RD_LZ4=y and CONFIG_RD_ZSTD=y, so the kernel can
# decompress all three - but the bootloader hands the image to the kernel and
# evidently requires the legacy LZ4 format that stock recovery ships. Every
# image that has ever booted on this device uses it.
#
# This also rules out zstd, which would otherwise have been very attractive:
#
#   lz4 legacy -12  28,905,980 bytes    (boots)
#   gzip -9         24,931,569 bytes    (BOOTLOOPS)
#   zstd -19        17,107,486 bytes    (untested, same risk, not worth it)
#
# The size budget must therefore be met by content, not compression.

# marks slot A unbootable without ever executing the ramdisk. Probable cause
# is a shared load region: stock vendor_boot declares a 25.556 MiB vendor
# ramdisk, and the Qualcomm loader checks the region against the sum of the
# recovery and vendor ramdisks.
#
# Budget every image against 29,000,000 bytes to keep margin. This is why no
# WLAN module, no prebuilt kernel and no stock HAL payload are packaged here.
